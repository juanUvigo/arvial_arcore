# ARVIAL ARCore Application

This application was made to evaluate ARCore Geospatial performance for AR augmented sign 
positioning on the side of the road.

Coordinates create anchors and those anchors show up using ARCore.

It is based upon the 
[ARCore Geospatial example app from Google](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/tree/main/samples/geospatial_java).
Kotlin integration and new Material design alongside Compose UI APIs is added.
